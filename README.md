# BitoTTT
## Outline of Program

1. **Initialize the Board:**
    - Create a 3x3 array to represent the Tic Tac Toe board.
    - Initialize the array with empty spaces to represent the empty cells.

2. **Display the Board:**
    - Create a method to display the current state of the board.

3. **Check for a Win or Draw:**
    - Create a method to check if the game is won by either the player or the computer.
    - Check rows, columns, and diagonals to see if there are three matching symbols.

4. **Player's Turn:**
    - Create a method to handle the player's turn.
    - Prompt the player to enter row and column numbers to place their symbol (X) on the board.
    - Check if the move is valid (not out of bounds and the cell is not already occupied).

5. **Computer's Turn:**
    - Create a method to handle the computer's turn.
    - Implement a simple algorithm to make the computer's move (e.g., random placement).

6. **Main Game Loop:**
    - Set up a loop to keep the game running until it's over.
    - Alternate between the player's turn and the computer's turn.
    - After each turn, display the board and check if there's a winner or a draw.

7. **Game Over:**
    - If there's a winner or a draw, display the result and end the game.
    - Ask the player if they want to play again.

8. **Additional Features (Optional):**
    - Implement a smarter computer AI using minimax algorithm for a more challenging opponent.
    - Add error handling for invalid user inputs.

Here's a basic outline for a one-player Tic Tac Toe game in Java. You can implement the methods and logic based on this outline. Remember to add more details and error handling as needed to make the game robust and user-friendly.
